# UFOs
Utilizing Javascript and Bootstrap
**(NOTE I could not get the server up and running in time so I will not be able to provide pictures but I will try my best for the analysis regardless, will update in the future)**
## Learning Goals
-Explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+.

-Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.

-Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.

-Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.

-Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).

-Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML

## Overview of Project: 
Create a web application to display information on UFO sightings 
## Results: 
The web page shows filters various results. Tables update in real time and don't need refreshing.
Filter results can be narrowed down to date, city and shape.
## Summary: 
The webpage allows users to filter through multiple criteria and instantly shows results. The bottle neck is the depth of the options which can be expanded upon with more work.
### Drawbacks: 
The filter method is case sensitive and needs a better search algorithm. Should add a calendar UI so users can click on it to accurately get the dates they want.
### Future Changes: 
Remove case-sensitivity in the textboxes. Add drop down menus
